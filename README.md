# Fine-Tuning Weights
All the fine-tuning weights for the ResNet3D architecture were taken from this repository https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch.
The fine-tuning starting weight used for this task is also present in [resnet-3d-18-kinemetics weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uGkkk57kUADfU6xkGjItomEftQZOAj4v/view?usp=share_link).
